      <p>Chicken (dalg-gogi) has long been a mainstay in Korean dishes and, at Le Menu, all of our poultry dishes are carefully crafted by veteran Korean chefs. Spicy or mild? Breaded or not? No matter what you choose, you won't lose!</p>

      <p>Japan may have introduced sushi (hoe) to the world, but in Korea, we've reinvented that wheel with countless savory flavors. Ask our staff about our daily specials. Oh, all of our fish are fresh-caught on the day they're cooked!</p>
